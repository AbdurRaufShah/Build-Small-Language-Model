# Small Language Model (SLM) Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for building and experimenting with a **Small Language Model (SLM)**.  
The project demonstrates how lightweight NLP models can be designed for efficiency and faster experimentation compared to Large Language Models (LLMs).

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Tokenization of text data  
- Model architecture configuration (vocab size, context length, layers, etc.)  
- Training workflow for a small transformer-based model  
- Focus on efficiency and resource optimization  

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SLM-Model.git
2. Open the notebook
jupyter notebook Build_SLM_Model.ipynb

3. Install dependencies
Make sure you have the required libraries installed:
pip install torch transformers jupyter

## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation
Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but require heavy computation.
This project explores the concept of Small Language Models (SLMs) â€” compact NLP models that balance performance, efficiency, and resource usage.

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure
Build_SLM_Model.ipynb â†’ Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation.
