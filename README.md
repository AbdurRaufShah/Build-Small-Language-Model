# Build-Small-Language-Model
Implementation of a Small Language Model (SLM) using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
# Small Language Model (SLM) Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for building and experimenting with a **Small Language Model (SLM)**.  
The project demonstrates how lightweight NLP models can be designed for efficiency and faster experimentation compared to Large Language Models (LLMs).

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Tokenization of text data  
- Model architecture configuration (vocab size, context length, layers, etc.)  
- Training workflow for a small transformer-based model  
- Focus on efficiency and resource optimization  

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SLM-Model.git
